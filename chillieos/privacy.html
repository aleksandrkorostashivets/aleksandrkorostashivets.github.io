    <p class="service__text">Chillieos.com Complete Privacy Policy</p>
    <p class="service__text">This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and share your personal information when you visit or make a purchase from Coming Soon (the "Site").</p>
    <h3 class="service__subtitle">WE COLLECT PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>
    <p class="service__text">We automatically collect certain information about your device when you visit the Site, such as information about your web browser, IP address, time zone, and some of the cookies that are installed on your device. Furthermore, as you navigate the Site, we collect information about the individual web pages or products that you view, what websites or search terms referred you to the Site, and how you interact with the Site. This automatically collected data is referred to as "Device Information."</p>
    <p class="service__text">The information you provide is a contractual obligation between us, the retailer, and you, the purchaser; the information we collect is primarily used to fulfill the purchasing and fulfillment contract on purchased goods. If these details are not supplied or withdrawn prior to our contract fulfillment, we will consider this a breach of contract and will be unable to fulfill the purchasing order.</p>
    <p class="service__text">We collect Device Information through the use of the following technologies:</p>
    <ul class="service__list" style="list-style: disc;">
      <li>
        <p class="service__text">"Cookies" are data files that are stored on your device or computer and frequently contain an anonymous unique identifier. Visit <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/" target="_blank" class="service__link">All About Cookies | Online Privacy and Digital Security</a> for more information on cookies and how to disable them.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="service__text">"Log files" track Site activity and collect information such as your IP address, browser type, Internet service provider, referring/exit pages, and date/time stamps.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="service__text">Web beacons, tags, and pixels are electronic files that record information about how you navigate the Site in order for it to function properly and provide useful recommendations.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="service__text">In this Privacy Policy, we refer to "Personal Information" as both Device Information and Order Information.</p>
    <p class="service__text">We do not collect any Personal Information about you. Sensitive data includes information about your race or ethnicity, religious or philosophical beliefs, sex life, sexual orientation, political opinions, trade union membership, health information, and genetic and biometric data. We do not collect data on criminal convictions and offenses.</p>
    <p class="service__text">If we are required by law or by the terms of our contract to collect personal data and you do not provide us with that data when requested, we may be unable to perform the contract (for example, to deliver goods or services to you). If you do not provide us with the requested information, we may be forced to cancel a product or service you have ordered; however, if this occurs, we will notify you immediately.</p>
    <p class="service__text">We will only use your personal data for the purpose for which it was collected, or for a reasonably compatible purpose if that is not possible. For more information, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@chillieos.com" class="service__link">support@chillieos.com</a>. If we need to use your information for an unrelated new purpose, we will notify you and explain the legal basis for processing.</p>
    <p class="service__text">Where required or permitted by law, we may process your personal data without your knowledge or consent.</p>
    <p class="service__text">We do not use any type of automated decision-making or profiling.</p>
    <p class="service__text">We occasionally list our products on other Third-Party marketplaces; if you place an order through one of these marketplaces, you are agreeing to provide the privacy and security policies to that marketplace, as well as agreeing to have your information provided to us, the retailer, for the contractual fulfillment of the purchasing contract.</p>
    <h3 class="service__subtitle">WHAT DO WE DO WITH YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h3>
    <p class="service__text">We use the Order Information we collect in general to fulfill any orders placed through the Site (including processing your payment information, arranging to ship, and sending you invoices and/or order confirmations). Furthermore, we use this Order Information to: </p>
    <ul class="service__list" style="list-style: disc;">
      <li>
        <p class="service__text">communicate with you;</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="service__text">complete/fulfill your order;</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="service__text">screen our orders for potential risk or fraud;</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="service__text">and, when appropriate, provide you with information or advertising relating to our products or services.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="service__text">We use the Device Information that we collect to help us screen for potential risk and fraud (specifically, your IP address), as well as to improve and optimize our Site more broadly (for example, by generating analytics about how our customers browse and interact with the Site, provide relevant ads to you, provide recommendations, and to assess the success of our marketing and advertising campaigns).</p>
    <p class="service__text">We may use your phone number and email address to legitimately notify you of the status of your order.</p>
    <h3 class="service__subtitle">DISCLAIMER OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>
    <p class="service__text">We ONLY share your Personal Information with relevant third parties to assist us in using your Personal Information to provide our services, as described above. For example, we use Google Analytics to better understand how our customers interact with the Site; you can learn more about how Google uses your Personal Information here: <a href="www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/" target="_blank" class="service__link">www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/</a>. You can also disable Google Analytics by visiting <a href="http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank" class="service__link">tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a>.</p>
    <p class="service__text">Finally, we may share your Personal Information in order to comply with applicable laws and regulations, to respond to a subpoena, search warrant, or other lawful requests for information we receive, or to protect our rights in other ways.</p>
    <h3 class="service__subtitle">YOUR DUTIES</h3>
    <p class="service__text">If you are a UK or EU/EU-GDPR applicable resident, you have the right to access your personal information and request that it be corrected, updated, or deleted. If you wish to exercise this right, please contact us using the information provided below.</p>
    <p class="service__text">Besides that, if you are a UK or EU/EU-GDPR applicable resident, please be aware that we process your information in order to fulfill contracts we may have with you (for example, if you place an order through the Site) or to pursue our legitimate business interests listed above. Furthermore, if your information is transferred outside of Europe, including to Canada and the United States, or to any country or company located outside of the UK/EU/EEA GDPR area, it is still subject to GDPR requirements.</p>
    <p class="service__text">We may need to ask you for specific information to confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal information is not disclosed to anyone who does not have the right to receive it. We may also contact you to request additional information about your request in order to expedite our response.</p>
    <p class="service__text">We make every effort to respond to all legitimate requests within a month. If your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests, it may take us longer than a month. We will notify you in this case.</p>
    <p class="service__text">You may also file a complaint with the supervisory body, The Information Commissioners Office.</p>
    <h3 class="service__subtitle">RETENTION OF DATA</h3>
    <p class="service__text">When you place an order through the Site, we will keep your Order Information for our records unless and until you request that we delete it.</p>
    <p class="service__text">We reserve the right to deny this "right to be forgotten" request in the following circumstances:</p>
    <ul class="service__list" style="list-style: disc;">
      <li>
        <p class="service__text">to exercise the right to free expression and information;</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="service__text">to comply with a legal obligation;</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="service__text">to carry out a task in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority;</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="service__text">or for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific research, historical research, or statistical purposes where erasure is likely to make that processing impossible or seriously impair the achievement of that processing.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="service__text">We will only keep your personal information for as long as is necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, including any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.</p>
    <p class="service__text">We consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure, the processing purposes, if these can be achieved through other means, and legal requirements when determining the appropriate time to keep the data.</p>
    <p class="service__text">The law requires us to keep basic information about our customers (including Contact, Identity, Financial, and Transaction Data) for six years after they cease to be customers for tax and anti-money laundering purposes.</p>
    <p class="service__text">We may anonymize your personal data for research or statistical purposes in some cases, in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.</p>
    <h3 class="service__subtitle">CHANGES</h3>
    <p class="service__text">We may update this privacy statement from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons.</p>
    <p class="service__text">By using our website, you agree to this privacy statement.</p>
