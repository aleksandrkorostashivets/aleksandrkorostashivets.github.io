                            The American shipbuilding scene, filled with participants constructing all manner of
                            vessels, has been navigating through stormy times (lately, yards along the Gulf Coast have
                            literally been dealing with storms). The orders for newbuild, repair and conversion projects
                            continue to flow in—albeit at a reduced pace—and the boats and ships go down the ways into
                            the water, but the overall panorama has seen tremendous sea changes as the business has
                            shifted.

                            Maritime businesses worldwide have been grappling with currents both internal and external.
                            Across the entire landscape in 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has brought about operational
                            changes that will continue into the future, long after Americans are vaccinated. Most U.S.
                            shipyards were identified early on as “essential businesses”, and therefore continued
                            working throughout 2020. The proactive attitude of one yard during 2020’s pandemic did not
                            go unnoticed, with Fincantieri Bay Shipbuilding (FBS) receiving the Northeast Wisconsin
                            Service Award. As explained in a press release from FBS, “The award honors the unsung heroes
                            of the coronavirus who helped keep Wisconsin moving while the state was shut down. Honorees
                            are selected for going above and beyond the call of duty in their respective fields or
                            industries.”

                            Throughout the maritime world, again reflecting broader trends, talk has turned to
                            “decarbonization” (with reduced CO2 going beyond notions of simply improving vessel
                            efficiency), which will have profound implications for vessel propulsion and fuel choices.
                            Initially, this trend has driven a movement toward liquefied natural gas (LNG) fueled
                            propulsion. In Pascagoula, Miss., the Halter Marine yard will soon be completing the tug
                            barge combination Q-Ocean Service / Q-LNG 4000, for Q-LNG. The 4,000 cubic meter unit will
                            be contracted to Shell, and will be handling both ship-to-ship and ship-to-shore transfers
                            of LNG to vessels and to shoreside LNG distribution depots.

                            Indicative of the currents, FBS, in Sturgeon Bay, Wis., held a modern day “keel laying
                            ceremony” (with pre-constructed modules laid in place), in late June, for an LNG bunker
                            barge, Clean Canaveral, that will provide fuel to shipping customers of NorthStar Midstream
                            (tied to private investor Oaktree Capital), along the U.S. East Coast, out of Jacksonville.
                            The 5,400 cubic meter articulated tug barge (ATB) unit will be owned by a new entity,
                            Polaris New Energy, which has options on two additional units.

                            Along the Gulf Coast, Eastern Shipbuilding- Panama City, Fla. has also been active in
                            multiple segments. The yard is in the midst of a three-vessel order for New York City’s
                            Staten Island Ferry. The first of the 4,500-passenger trio, Sgt Michael Ollis, is set to be
                            delivered in late 2020 (after being delayed due to Hurricane Michael in 2018), with a second
                            vessel, Sandy Ground, launched in June 2020. The yard has continued to work, in the midst of
                            the pandemic and an active hurricane season. In August, Eastern, which had previously been a
                            prodigious producer of tugboats, delivered the 5,100 hp Z-drive ship-handling tug A. Thomas
                            Higgins to E.N. Bisso (following up on a sister vessel C.D. White delivered earlier in the
                            year).

                            Also in the Gulf, the Metal Shark facilities, encompassing three locations in Louisiana and
                            Alabama, have been active, with a varied construction slate. The Bayou La Batre, Ala.
                            facility (previously the Horizon Shipyard) recently delivered a 6,000 hp boat to Florida
                            Marine Transporters (FMT), the first of a three boat order, and the yard’s first towboat for
                            the inland marketplace. The Metal Shark yards have also continued to deliver ferries to NYC
                            Ferry (in New York) and to Potomac Water Taxi, in the Washington, D.C. area. Metal Shark,
                            also a prolific builder of fast boats for law enforcement and for military users, credits
                            “series production” to its ability to deliver vessels rapidly and at scale, at a time that
                            cities such as New York seek to move commuters from automobiles onto ferries.

                            A different sort of environmental theme (against a backdrop of increased funding for
                            dredging) is evidenced most recently with Eastern Shipbuilding beginning construction on a
                            second new 8,550-cubic-yard trailing suction hopper dredge for Weeks Marine Inc. (with a
                            previous unit delivered in 2017). Elsewhere, Conrad Shipyard is building a 6,500-cubic-yard
                            TSHD for Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Corporation. And the Keppel AmFELS yard at Brownsville,
                            Texas announced an order for a 15,000-cubic-yard hopper dredge, to be delivered in 2023 to
                            Manson Construction. The yard (historically a builder of jack-up rigs) is also constructing
                            two LNG-fueled containerships that will be deployed by Pasha Hawaii in the Jones Act trades
                            from the West Coast.

                            2020. The vessels, readily upgradable for LNG fueling in the future, will serve in the

                            With oil price wars and trade wars, economists can argue about whether we are in a
                            “slowdown” or a “recession”. However, weak demand on the commercial side (energy and also
                            agricultural) has seen a counterbalance from the government side. The Philly Shipyard has
                            chosen to pivot from commercial to government work- with the contract award emphasizing a
                            need to infuse commercial best-practices. The Philly Shipyard, which had completed a pair of
                            container vessels for Matson, is now set to begin construction, initially, of two training
                            ships destined for maritime academies (with the first going to Fort Schuyler- State
                            University of New York). The newbuilds, with Tote Inc managing the actual contracting and
                            construction process for the U.S. Maritime Administration, will go way beyond their role in
                            training maritime cadets. As National Security Multi-Mission Vessels, their capabilities
                            will enable them to respond to natural disasters, and provide humanitarian aid. The vessels,
                            set to join the National Defense Reserve Fleet, will have ro-ro capabilities (for heavy
                            equipment) and extensive berthing capacity. NASSCO, with no additional deepsea commercial
                            orders announced, is putting its tanker expertise to work, building a series of fleet oilers
                            for the U.S. Navy. Halter Marine is also constructing vessels for the Coast Guard and the
                            Navy, and Eastern is building the Coast Guard’s first offshore patrol cutters.

                            Bollinger’s Lockport, La. yard scored a big win in late September with a U.S. Coast Guard
                            awarding a newbuild contract, with four fast response cutters to be delivered during 2022
                            and 2023. The group also recently received an order for a floating drydock that will service
                            U.S. Navy submarines at General Dynamics Electric Boat yard at Groton, Conn. Austal, another
                            yard with commercial work in its past at its Mobile, Ala. yard (the old Bender facility),
                            has delivered a fast transport ship to the U.S. Navy, with multiple transports also under
                            construction. Like other yards, it has benefited from government work, in this case, with a

                            The sustainability trend looms large. In the not too distant future, additional U.S. built
                            vessels will be needed to serve offshore wind energy projects. The rumor mill is whirring
                            about numerous discussions said to be underway between project developers and U.S. owners
                            regarding installation vessels. Matt Tremblay, ABS Senior Vice President, Global Offshore,
                            told Marine News, “ABS is involved in a range of projects to support the development of the
                            U.S. offshore wind industry, including providing services to vessels destined to be
                            constructed in U.S. shipyards.” He added, “As the industry and the turbines continue to grow
                            in size and complexity, the vessels needed to install them in U.S. waters will need to be
                            built, and we are seeing increased demand for increasingly specialized vessels. ABS is
                            involved in advanced discussions with key players on the development of further Jones Act
                            vessels which will be key to the development of the U.S. industry.”

                            Tremblay explained further, “At the end of 2019 ABS granted VARD the first Approval in
                            Principle (AIP) for a Jones Act service operations vessel (SOV), with primary functions
                            including accommodation, transferring technicians to installations as well as storing spare
                            parts and tools for operations in U.S. offshore wind farms. That milestone has been followed
                            by further AIPs both to VARD for a large SOV and to BAR and Chartwell Marine for an
                            innovative Jones Act crew transfer vessel.”

                            Tremblay pointed to the class society’s prominent role in wind energy’s buildout, evolving
                            analogously to offshore oil drilling towards floating units. “ABS provides leading
                            classification services for wind support vessels, including self-elevating units, wind
                            turbine installations vessels and offshore support vessels. ABS classed the largest wind
                            farm installation jack-up Seajacks Scylla in 2015 and earlier this year, to the first
                            floating heavy lift installation vessel to be built in Taiwan, Green Jade. ABS is also a
                            world leader in classing floating offshore wind, in process of classing nearly 80 megawatts
                            of floating wind.”

                                <p>Vane Brothers, a leading participant in coastal and harbor movements of petroleum
                                    products and ship bunkering, has been a major customer of U.S. yards. Capt. Jim
                                    Demske, who is in charge of newbuild construction at the Baltimore based vessel
                                    owner, explained his criteria for sizing up a potential builder of new equipment for
                                    Vane. He explained, “Among many considerations, I want to know the yard’s reputation
                                    for constructing the type of tug required by Vane Brothers. I need to be certain
                                    they can build the design to our specifications, deliver it in a timely manner, and
                                    bring it in at our budgeted cost.”</p>
                                <p>Recent Vane newbuilds have included three Assateague class ATBs (built at Conrad
                                    Shipyards with 4,400 bhp tugs coupled to 80,000 bbl barges) and two Salisbury class
                                    push boats (3,000 bhp), suitable for the inland rivers. Two more of the push boats
                                    are under construction, at Chesapeake Shipbuilding (which has also carved out a
                                    niche in building small river cruise vessels for American Cruise Lines).</p>
                                <p>Capt. Demsky continued, “If the yard has been building tugs for many years, there is
                                    a good chance I have been aboard some of their tugs or designs. I would already have
                                    a good idea of what I like about their builds, their strengths and weaknesses, and
                                    what the yard can provide to ensure that new Vane vessels maximize safety,
                                    performance and crew comfort.”</p>
                                <p>Vane Brothers takes a hands-on approach, with Capt. Demsky telling Marine News, “I
                                    like to walk the yard and talk with management and supervisors to get a feel for the
                                    knowledge and expertise they offer. The rapport we are able to build is always
                                    important, since I will be interacting with yard personnel on a nearly daily basis
                                    for the length of the project. During the walk, I also look to see whether the yard
                                    is well kept and efficiently laid out. If the yard is clean and organized, I feel
                                    better about entrusting them with a Vane Brothers project.”</p>
