					<p>Casinos in movies aren’t always the most relaxing places. Maybe they’re the setting of a James Bond
						film, where Bond — in a debonair but decidedly uncomfortable suit — is engaged in a life-or-death
						poker match, wiping beads of sweat from his brow. Maybe they’re the backdrop of a heist movie, where
						millions of dollars are at stake and every character looks paranoid. Even in buddy comedies, like
						Swingers, casinos aren’t exactly temples of relaxation. But our cruise casino is different.</p>
					<h2>Cruise casino experience</h2>
					<p>You might be playing the same games at sea as you are on land, but there’s something about watching
						the water drift by out the window that makes all the stress wash away. There’s also something about
						wearing a tank top and sandals, rather than a Bond-esque suit, that brings the anxiety level down a
						few notches. Our cruise ship casino isn’t an exclusive Monte Carlo experience — it’s an inclusive
						gaming experience that’s designed to capture the fun and thrills of Vegas without sacrificing
						TopWorldDeals casual atmosphere.</p>
					<h2>What to expect at our casino</h2>
					<p>Even if you’re not a gambler, just strolling down the rows of slot machines and checking out all the
						different themes can be a fun way to kill some time. And if you are a gambler — well, buckle up,
						because we’ve got game variety in spades (sometimes literally). </p>
					<h2>Electronic slot machines</h2>
					<p>We’ve got 115 slot machines on our gaming floor — 104 on the main floor and 11 in the smoking room —
						that range from traditional slots to multi-line and even video poker. We stay as up-to-date as
						possible on the latest games so there’s always something new to try out, whether it be Lightning Link,
						Buffalo Gold, Adventure Alley, or Little Asia. You could easily spend a whole day losing yourself in
						the immersive electronic worlds of our slot machines (not that we’d, you know, recommend that). </p>
					<h2>Table games</h2>
					<p>If simply pulling a lever or pushing a button isn’t quite enough stimulation for you, there’s nothing
						like playing blackjack on cruise ships. Well, except poker, craps, Texas Hold ‘em, and roulette, of
						course. We’ve got it all. Here’s a breakdown of all the games we offer: blackjack, single deck
						blackjack, craps, three-card poker,
						Ultimate Texas Hold’em, baccarat, and double zero & single zero roulette.</p>
					<h2>Complimentary casino gaming lessons</h2>
					<p>If you’re scratching your head about what those words even mean, don’t worry. We have seasoned gaming
						pros on hand to show you the ropes. That’s the beauty of our cruise casino vs. a typical Vegas casino
						— we want to give you the best chance to win. That’s why, on embarkation day, we offer complimentary
						gaming lessons on the casino floor. You’ll learn the ins and outs of games like craps, poker,
						blackjack, and the best ways of tilting the odds in your favor.</p>
					<h2>You might win, you might lose, but you'll have fun</h2>
					<p>But like most games, it’s not really about winning (though that’s obviously the goal), it’s about
						having fun and maybe even meeting new friends. Nothing brings people together like going on a 7’s
						streak in craps, or cheering on the guy next to you as he doubles down a huge blackjack bet. So wear
						your lucky socks and walk into the casino with cautious optimism. You might win, you might lose, but
						the real victory is meeting and connecting with fellow cautious optimists. You might make a
						voyage-long friend. After all, the casino has a bar and cigar lounge – so it’s easy to segue into a
						more social setting.</p>
